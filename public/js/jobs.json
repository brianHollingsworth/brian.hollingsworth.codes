    "Icon": "images/Company_Icons/Maverick.png",
    "Description": "The most important job I had during college. I started working for Maverick as a Student Software Engineer from the spring semester of my sophomore year to the penultimate week of my senior year. Maverick contracts with <a href=\"https://www.veritas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Veritas Technologies</a> (formerly Symantec) to give college students the opportunity to gain crucial real-world experience by working as SQA developers.<br> I wrote countless Perl scripts to automate the test scenarios for <a href=\"https://www.veritas.com/product/backup-and-recovery/netbackup-8.html?inid=us_veritas_home_products_netbackup-8\" target=\"_blank\">NetBackup</a>, the world's leading backup and recovery solution for enterprise data centers and hybrid clouds.<br> When I wasn't coding for Maverick, I was out promoting future \"Mavs\" to take a chance and apply. I still advocate for Maverick whenever I can, like when I return to St. Cloud State for CSCI Club, or when I bump into a TDP summer intern at Optum who's looking for advice before they return to school."

    "Icon": "images/Company_Icons/Symantec.png",
    "Description": "I came into my internship with Symantec already having over a full year of experience with the company from my work as a consultant at Maverick. I continued my work with automating test scripts in an Agile environment to which I had been accustomed. My biggest challenge was writing automated scripts and Perl subroutines for Symantec's NetBackup CLI commands to test their functionality with NetBackup's GA front-end web interface, Self Service (formerly Biomni Front Office)."

    "Icon": "images/Company_Icons/Marnanteli's.png",
    "Description": "Marnanteli's will always be one of my favorite jobs. I began working at the best pizza place in Sartell during my senior year of high school. Starting out at \"the bottom of the totem pole\", I spent the first couple months of my pizza career honing my craft for making the perfect pizza. When I wasn't making works of art in the kitchen, I was cruising around town, delivering lunch and dinner to the wonderful individuals & families of Sartell, Sauk Rapids, Rice, and St. Cloud.<br>I moved up to a manager role about a year after my start date, which meant I needed to be officially recognized as a \"person in charge\" by Minnesota Department of Health Food Code. That title put extra responsibility on my shoulders for ensuring safe food handling practices amongst my staff members."

    "Icon": "images/Company_Icons/Merrill.png",
    "Description": "Even though delivering pizzas for minimum wage and tips was decent money for an 18-year-old, I knew I needed a second source of income to pay for college on my own. This was a 'flex' position that allowed me to work every day that I didn't work at Marnanteli's; so, in a span of less than six months, I went from not having a job to working two jobs, seven days per week.<br>I processed, troubleshot, and completed sales orders (navigating on Windows 7 and Windows XP environments). Prior to production, I quality checked sample prints of files to ensure pristine print quality for client orders. I also prepared, ran, and maintained high-volume digital printers (Oc√© VarioPrint 6250 and Xerox DocuColor 8000/8080)."
