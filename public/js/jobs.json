    "Description": "<u>CorpCard/U.S. Bank:</u> Developed an Optum-certified REST API to enhance the user experience for site admins. Certain employees at UnitedHealth Group require company travel and/or purchasing cards, and the old process for obtaining a card was as follows: internally apply for a card; wait for the request to be approved by a manager; wait for site admins to email the request to our bank affilate; and then wait for our bank affiliate to process the request and send a card in the mail. Notice a trend? There was A LOT of waiting involved. Today, my API directly connects with our bank affiliate's processing service. This allows UHG's corporate card admins to send as many card requests as they like with a single click.</br></br><u>GDPR:</u> After the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was adopted, UnitedHealth Group put together measures for ensuring personal data of its EU employees is kept for only as long as it is being processed for technical and organizational purposes; after which, that data is deemed \"in scope\" for purging. My GDPR program parses identifying information (ID, name, email, etc.) from the \"in scope\" data, queries for records of that information against all of UHG's platforms, and deletes all instances of those records. The true beauty of my program comes from its modularity; I designed it to dynamically change as UHG's presence in Europe expands. Now that I have completed its development, the behavior of my application changes as the EU data protection regime changes.",

    "Description": "<u>Selenium:</u> A few days into my new role, I noticed glaring issues in the testing practices for nearly all of my team's applications. Using my automation knowledge from Maverick, it took one demo of Selenium to send a sizemic shift in my team's plan for ATDD. It took me a couple months for my team to go from 100% manual testing to having a lead developer in automated testing (me).</br></br><u>ConcurSTBT:</u> An automated, console-based application that analyzes monthly payroll taxation expense reports. The batch imports and analyzes the content of flight origin and destination records for domestic airport expenses.</br></br><u>SureLock:</u> Optum has been making a huge effort towards becoming fully agile, which required building agile workspaces and mobile lockers in place of archaic cubicles with lockers. SureLock is an internal Node.js application built on top of OpenShift Enterprise that provides employees with a portal to quickly allocate a mobile locker at any one of Optum's agile workspaces.",

    "Description": "My first go-round with Optum's fantastic Technology Development Program (TDP). TDP interns are introduced to Optum and UnitedHealth Group by working closely with technology professionals, mentors, and leaders over a 12-week period. I spent the summer of 2016 working as a Java Applications Developer on an internal database application that focused on UnitedHealthcare member activity collection (MAC). To put it in a nutshell, UHC insures <i>a lot</i> of companies, ranging from small family shops with single-digit employees to enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees. The majority of insurance plans involve providing members with monetary compensations when said members complete health-related tasks, like getting a physical. If a member believes his or her compensation is too small, for example, he or she can file a claim to have the compensation corrected. Those claims get sent to data analysts who sift through millions of entries; that's where MAC comes in. Without revealing too much, MAC finds and returns all CLOB claim entries based on the parameters provided by an XML template file. MAC then inserts entries for those members who need recompensation, which provides a clear picture of how many insured members need to be justly repaid.",
